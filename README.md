# Project Overview: Model training
* The dataset was preprocessed by separating numerical and categorical features and stored in a new variable.
* Preprocessing techniques such as column transformer, standard scaler, and OneHotEncoder were used to prepare the data for modeling.
* An Evaluate Function was created to calculate various evaluation metrics after training each model.
* The models were then sorted by their best r2 score.
* Finally, a Linear Regression model was used for the project.

# Project Overview: EDA & FE
* The dataset was explored using various EDA techniques such as checking for missing values, data types, and summary statistics.
* Univariate analysis techniques such as histograms, kernel density plots, and box plots were used to understand the distribution and spread of individual variables in the dataset.
* Bivariate analysis techniques such as scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices were used to explore the relationship between different variables in the dataset.
* Outliers and anomalies were detected using box plots and scatter plots.
* Correlation analysis was performed to identify the most significant features in the dataset.
* The EDA process provided valuable insights into the data, which were used to inform the preprocessing and modeling steps.
