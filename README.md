# Project Overview: Model training
* The dataset was preprocessed by separating numerical and categorical features and stored in a new variable.
* Preprocessing techniques such as column transformer, standard scaler, and OneHotEncoder were used to prepare the data for modeling.
* An Evaluate Function was created to calculate various evaluation metrics after training each model.
* The models were then sorted by their best r2 score.
* Finally, a Linear Regression model was used for the project.
